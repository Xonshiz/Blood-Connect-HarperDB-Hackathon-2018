# HarperDB-Hackathon-2018

This application is built for the sole purpose of the [`HarperDB Hackathon, 2018`](www.harperdb.io/harperdb-virtual-hackathon-2018). The aim of this application is to make it easier for people to request and donate blood. The application shows a list of various requesters in your State. It only shows the list of matching blood types, which makes it further easier to distinguish the entries.

The data collected from the users is solely used for generating Insights like Density of Blood groups in a country, state or world.

    - Internet Access
    - View WiFi Connections
    - Storage (Read/Write Perms For Cache)
    - Read Google Service Configuration
    
- #### Instructions For Direct APK Installation :
    If you want to run this application on your android phone, please move over to the "[`Release`](https://github.com/Xonshiz/HarperDB-Hackathon-2018/releases/latest)" section and download the latest stable APK build for your android phone. You do not need any external libraries or application.

- #### Instructions For Developers/Testers :
     If you're a developer or any user who wishes to test this application and run this android project, it's recommended to install Visual Studio with Xamarin Support and Android SDKs on your system. Remember that Android SDKs should be in your local path for you to be able to compile the project properly. You can find the source code in the "[SOURCE](https://github.com/Xonshiz/HarperDB-Hackathon-2018/tree/master/app/BloodConnect)" directory.

    If you do not happen to have Visual Studio, it is recommended to get it because it'll download all the required packages on its own, if they're not present. You can use Visual Studio's Free Community Edition. It'll work, as we've developed this application on it.
But, if for some reason, you don't want to or can't install Visual Studio, you will need to have .NET, Xamarin, Android SDK and required Packages in your system's local path for you to be able to compile and execute this application project.
