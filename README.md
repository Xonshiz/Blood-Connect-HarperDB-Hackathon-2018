# HarperDB-Hackathon-2018

This application is built for the sole purpose of the [HarperDB Hackathon, 2018]. The aim of this application is to make it easier for people to request and donate blood. The application shows a list of various requesters in your State. It only shows the list of matching blood types, which makes it further easier to distinguish the entries.

The data collected from the users is solely used for generating Insights like Density of Blood groups in a country, state or world.

Presentation for this project can be found in `HarperDB Presentation` directory/folder. Whereas, the source code can be found in the `app` directory/folder.
